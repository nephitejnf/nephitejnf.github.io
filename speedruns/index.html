<p>This is mostly meant as a record of runs made in Crystal Clear.
Definitions for categories are here, if you are looking for a
reference, too. There is a lot of information to help with routing
in the docs. You may also discussing routing, other faster tricks,
or an idea for another category in #speedrunning on the
discord.</p>
<p>Runs address to be done in video format. This is to verify
validity and honest play, the game screen and a timer should both
be in the video. Video submissions should be sent to nephitejnf to
be verified and then they'll be posted on the site. Video
submissions should prefferably be done with Youtube videos for ease
of embeding.</p>
<p>Submissions will be separated by versions. Submissions for the
current version are cut off after a new version is pushed out.</p>
</div>
<div id="categories">
<ul>
<li>any%</li>
<p>This Category is about like any other any%, just get from start
to finish (beating the E4) faster than anyone else.</p>
<li>Silver%</li>
<p>Beat the Mt. Silver battle and get all 16 badges.</p>
<li>starter%</li>
<p>Same criteria as Silver%, but with just your starter. Any other
pokemon are used as HM slaves.</p>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="verions">
<p>Version that have had runs.</p>
<ul>
<li>1.3b -- Only by Exarion, WR in any% and starter%</li>
<li>2.0 Beta -- Still awaiting run submissions</li>

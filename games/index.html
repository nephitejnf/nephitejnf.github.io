It might have been a phase, too...</p><a href="https://github.com/nephitejnf/Adventure-of-Me">Repo</a><p></p><h3>Rogue Colors: Back burner</h3><p id="descrip">This started out as a game idea, then turned into a game engine idea. I wanted it to be moddable like Dungeons of Dredmor, but I wanted simplicity. That turned into a roguelike engine based on simplicity.</p><h3>Pokemon Bloodred: Back burner</h3><p id="descrip">This as a fan-game. It is done in RPG Maker XP with Pokemon Essentials GS.</p><h3>A mysterious romhack with pokecrystal</h3><p id="descrip">It's a secret right now. I'll share more when further details are made.</p></div><div id="programs"><h2>Programs</h2><p>Nothing here, yet.
